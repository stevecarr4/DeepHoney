## DeepHoney: An AI-Powered Advanced Threat Detection System Using Honeypots ##

DeepHoney is an advanced threat detection system that combines the power of honeypots and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and analyze potential attacks. By deploying AI-powered honeypots, DeepHoney attracts malicious actors, captures their activities, and uses machine learning algorithms to detect and classify their behavior.

## Features ##

Utilizes Python libraries such as Scapy for network interactions and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for AI capabilities.
Deploys honeypots strategically to mimic vulnerable services and lure attackers.
Captures network traffic, analyzes packets, and extracts relevant features for further analysis.
Uses machine learning models to classify and identify potential threats based on captured data.
Generates real-time alerts for detected malicious activities.
Provides detailed logging and reporting of captured network traffic.

## Installation ##

To install and run DeepHoney, follow these steps:

Clone the DeepHoney repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/deephoney.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage ##

Configure the honeypot settings and AI models in the appropriate files (config.py and ml_model.py).
Run the main script to start DeepHoney: python main.py

## Configuration ##

The config.py file allows you to customize various aspects of DeepHoney's configuration. You can specify honeypot settings, network interactions, logging options, and more. Adjust the configuration values according to your requirements.

The ml_model.py file contains the AI model implementation and configuration. You can modify the model architecture, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing techniques to improve detection accuracy.

## Structure ##

The DeepHoney project structure is organized as follows:

config.py: Configuration file for DeepHoney's settings and parameters.
honeypot.py: Honeypot implementations, including TCP and HTTP honeypots.
main.py: Entry point of the DeepHoney system, coordinates different components.
ml_model.py: Machine learning model for analyzing captured network traffic and detecting threats.
network_interaction.py: Network interaction and packet capturing functionalities.
